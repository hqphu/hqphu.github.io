      <h2>Central Figure of Christ:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        At the heart of the composition is Christ, depicted as a powerful and
        authoritative figure, radiating divine judgment. His raised right hand
        signifies condemnation, casting the damned into Hell, while his lowered
        left hand indicates mercy and salvation for the blessed. This dual
        gesture underscores the dichotomy of divine justice. Surrounding Christ
        are the Virgin Mary and a host of saints, reflecting their intercessory
        roles and emphasizing Christ's central role in Christian salvation
        history.

      <h2>Dynamic and Chaotic Composition:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Michelangelo's use of a dynamic and swirling composition creates a sense
        of movement and turmoil. The saved, on the left side of Christ, are
        shown ascending towards Heaven, assisted by angels, symbolizing their
        salvation and eternal reward. Conversely, on the right, the damned are
        depicted being dragged down to Hell by demons, illustrating their
        eternal punishment. This chaotic arrangement serves to highlight the
        dramatic nature of the Last Judgment and the finality of each soul's
        fate.

      <h2>Representation of Saints and Martyrs:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The fresco features numerous saints and martyrs who can be identified by
        their specific attributes and the instruments of their martyrdom. For
        instance, Saint Bartholomew holds his flayed skin, referencing his
        martyrdom, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria is shown with a wheel, the
        instrument of her torture. These figures serve to remind viewers of the
        trials and sacrifices of the saints, as well as their triumphant roles
        in the heavenly court, reinforcing the virtues of faith and endurance.

      <h2>Depiction of Final Judgment:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        "The Last Judgment" portrays the Christian eschatological belief in the
        final judgment of souls at the end of the world. According to this
        belief, Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. The fresco
        dramatically captures this moment, illustrating the ultimate fate of
        humanity, where souls are judged and separated into those who are saved
        and those who are damned.
      </p>

    <div class="data" id="infoFive">
      <h2>Symbolism and Allegory:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        "The Last Judgment" is replete with symbolic elements and allegorical
        figures. Angels and demons battle for souls, symbolizing the eternal
        struggle between good and evil. The resurrection of the dead at the
        bottom of the fresco illustrates the Christian belief in bodily
        resurrection, while Charon, the mythological ferryman of the dead from
        Dante's "Inferno," is included to draw a connection between Christian
        and classical themes of the afterlife. Additionally, the fresco reflects
        Michelangelo's deep understanding of human anatomy and emotion, using
        physical form and expression to convey complex theological ideas about
        sin, redemption, and divine justice.
