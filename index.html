    <p>An Analysis of Sculpting Harmony by Getty</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
      the experience? It starts with a song. Upon entering Sculpting Harmony, an
      online web exhibition by the Getty, the user is immediately greeted by an
      animation with bold colours, and a large display font that immediately
      inserts the user into the branding story of its experience. Dvorak
      Symphony 7 plays as it establishes the space the user enters, and the
      first scroll transforms the page elements to reveal an interactive art
      exhibit webpage experience.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions. A scroll, and another, and another, and finally… a
      click. Oh, and another scroll! The Sculpting Harmony follows a
      scrollytelling web format and relies on the user scroll progression to
      initiate the storytelling experience. The website introduces various
      interactive multimedia elements from images, videos, diagrams and even
      interactive 3D models of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It is through
      Sculpting Harmony, the Getty presents how the Walt Disney Concert Hall
      established in Los Angeles came to be. Spamming scrolls and clicks are
      able to skip parts of the website scroll. But during key sections of the
      webpage, media begins to spread the entire viewport to visually indicate a
      point of user immersion to consume exhibition content. Point bars are
      provided to pause, play and skip parts of these video sequences and assist
      navigation. To engage audiences with the web-exhibit, the Getty displays
      and uses a variety of media forms such as interactive 3D models to explore
      the building structure, documentaries delivered from Frank Gehry himself,
      and changing music compositions featured in the Walt Disney Music Hall.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      Sculpting Harmony excites the interaction by providing interactive web 3D
      models for the user to explore the Walt Disney Hall throughout points of
      its development. Architectural models of the musical hall allow to user to
      pan and observe the geometries of the building. This directly activates
      the user’s physical engagement by manipulating the viewpoint of these
      models and allows further immersion and provides reinforced insight into
      the exhibition’s communication. The Getty’s inclusions of such allow the
      user to observe and play with historical artifacts of the music hall’s
      development in real-time. It conveys a sense of realism and involvement
      with these histories, and empowers the education the art exhibit informs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience? Following the interaction of a scrollytelling webpage,
      Sculpting Harmony depends on this interaction to initiate and progress the
      webpage experience. Display content is asynchronous with Dvorak’s Symphony
      7 and correspondingly depends on the user’s scroll instead to reveal the
      exhibit’s elements. It provides a more immersive visual experience by
      triggering content to the user’s scroll and information is sequenced
      linearly and absorbed for the user’s comprehension of the digital exhibit.
      At various points of the sequence however, particularly at chapter titles,
      Sculpting Harmony adopts more conventional website interactions, allowing
      the user to click to skip and initiate the next section of content.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience? 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this
      primary goal? As the journey continues and reveals itself progressively
      with every scroll, it is clear that the user continues the exhibit with
      this downward scroll to its end. Along with following occasional exhibit
      commands and annotations to assist with navigation, downward scrolls
      become the foundational action to and the main path “forward”. Sculpting
      Harmony guides this experience through revealing new content with this
      single gesture. In sections and scene of stagnation, the webpage will
      provide text to determine the next intended action from the user to help
      progress the exhibit onward.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times) 8) How does the
      interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over
      time? The webpage menu provides 5 different major sections and chapters to
      the web experience however, the length of each remains ambiguous to the
      user. There is no indication besides the side scroll bar to suggest the
      length. With each introduction of different interactive web sections, the
      changing video lengths disorient indications of the user’s progression. In
      way’s, the user is forced to remain in anticipation of the exhibit’s next
      presentation. Sculpting Harmony does allow the user to jump content
      offerings however, the original single scroll layout is preserved as the
      main path of the webpage/exhibitions navigation. By entering and exiting
      through exhibit content, users are eventually returned to this path as
      they absorb the website’s content as they switch between passive and
      active interaction with the website’s media.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference? 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
      should act when engaging with your research experience? 11) What does this
      reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging
      with your research experience? As the user sequences through the story of
      Sculpting Harmony, the website transitions between written text,
      documentaries of interviews with Frank Gehry and 3D model of the Walt
      Disney Music Hall during its architectural development. The structuring of
      this digital content is still systemic however, it generally follows TEXT
      -> Video Documentary -> 3D Interactive Artifact. This formula structures
      the scrollytelling format for the digital art exhibit and its relative
      chapters. With some chapters exclusively exhibiting video media, user
      expectations are unintuitive, although this sensibility effectively makes
      users submit to the exhibit’s narrative and forthcoming story. It is
      evident that with the webpage’s experience, users are to simply absorb the
      exhibit and its presentations, opposed to a complete self-autonomy in its
      information. In this sense, the website becomes a strategic narrative
      experience, one to educate and insight readers of the Walt Disney Music
      Halls conception.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating? Although transitions assist continuity and
      seamlessness between the exhibit scenes, transitions and animations can
      become hindrances in user’s mobility up and down the webpage. While these
      are intended to immerse information between content and chapters, this
      affords the user time to process or complete these visual effects before
      they are able to return to previously viewed scenes or jump sections.
      While the website addresses this through a menu bar accessible in the top
      right, the menu in itself contains transitions for bold display fonts and
      transitions to transport the user back to specific sections of the
      exhibit.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying? Despite this, Sculpting Harmony by the Getty,
      and its website transport’s its audience into a deeply immersive web
      experience, translating its platform into a multisensory digital exhibit.
      The website’s scrollytelling content invites users to unwind, and allows
      it to display and sequence the experience for the user. With the simple
      gesture of a scroll, new content reveals itself with multimedia displays
      delivering the history of The Walt Disney Concert Hall’s conception.
      Homaging architectural and engineering pioneering, and cultural and
      community shifts, this experience preserves the site’s heritage by
      engaging and implementing text, image, video, and 3D computer graphic
      media, into a captivating digital account.
