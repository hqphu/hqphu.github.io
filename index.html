  <!-- As part project I intend to develop a codebase that exhibits artwork into a digital form that engages with the audience to further their undertsanding of the work's background intent by providing further interactivity.
  Often, in physical galleries patrons take an observational approach to art consumption. However it is through digital formats that this project hopes to exemplify the process of understanding an artwork by engaging the audience through inputs and play. -->

  Hover is harnessed to provided the user to seamlessly but also flamboyantly reveal the artwork's title.
  The small gesture of a hover intends to provide an ease to the user to gather information of the art work and its history.
  Notice I have situated the artwork as also a png to provided a static media to allow the user to observe the art in isolation as found in real life.
  This is a presevation of the art consumption process found in galleries and again, allows the user to easily gesture away from the title element hitbox.

      <h2>Central Figure of Christ:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        At the heart of the composition is Christ, depicted as a powerful and
        authoritative figure, radiating divine judgment. His raised right hand
        signifies condemnation, casting the damned into Hell, while his lowered
        left hand indicates mercy and salvation for the blessed. This dual
        gesture underscores the dichotomy of divine justice. Surrounding Christ
        are the Virgin Mary and a host of saints, reflecting their intercessory
        roles and emphasizing Christ's central role in Christian salvation
        history.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="data" id="infoThree">
      <h2>Dynamic and Chaotic Composition:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Michelangelo's use of a dynamic and swirling composition creates a sense
        of movement and turmoil. The saved, on the left side of Christ, are
        shown ascending towards Heaven, assisted by angels, symbolizing their
        salvation and eternal reward. Conversely, on the right, the damned are
        depicted being dragged down to Hell by demons, illustrating their
        eternal punishment. This chaotic arrangement serves to highlight the
        dramatic nature of the Last Judgment and the finality of each soul's
        fate.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="data" id="infoFour">
      <h2>Representation of Saints and Martyrs:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The fresco features numerous saints and martyrs who can be identified by
        their specific attributes and the instruments of their martyrdom. For
        instance, Saint Bartholomew holds his flayed skin, referencing his
        martyrdom, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria is shown with a wheel, the
        instrument of her torture. These figures serve to remind viewers of the
        trials and sacrifices of the saints, as well as their triumphant roles
        in the heavenly court, reinforcing the virtues of faith and endurance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="data" id="infoOne">
      <h2>Depiction of Final Judgment:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        "The Last Judgment" portrays the Christian eschatological belief in the
        final judgment of souls at the end of the world. According to this
        belief, Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. The fresco
        dramatically captures this moment, illustrating the ultimate fate of
        humanity, where souls are judged and separated into those who are saved
        and those who are damned.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="data" id="infoFive">
      <h2>Symbolism and Allegory:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        "The Last Judgment" is replete with symbolic elements and allegorical
        figures. Angels and demons battle for souls, symbolizing the eternal
        struggle between good and evil. The resurrection of the dead at the
        bottom of the fresco illustrates the Christian belief in bodily
        resurrection, while Charon, the mythological ferryman of the dead from
        Dante's "Inferno," is included to draw a connection between Christian
        and classical themes of the afterlife. Additionally, the fresco reflects
        Michelangelo's deep understanding of human anatomy and emotion, using
        physical form and expression to convey complex theological ideas about
        sin, redemption, and divine justice.

    been contained to allow for visual manipulation into CSS. They appear as
    dots on top of the Pixelation version of the artwork below the original PNG

    <!-- the canvas element below is used to harness the ability to draw the artwork onto the webpage and provide the image with interactive animations and be able to react to the user input as intended for the project -->
    <!-- In this project, the canvas element harnesses the ability to appropriate the
    artwork and create an interactive variant of it. The product I have left is
    a liquid pixellation of the original artwork png which has been embedded as
    a Base64 to allow canvas to contain individual pixel information. As the
    user hovers across the artwork the pixel information is dissolved a creates a visual appeal to the user that responds to their input.
    In doing so the canvas visuals emphasise the user's hover, encourages and intimacy with artwork, and gamifies the process of opening the dots on the artwork for learning about its history. -->
    <!-- The dots have further been situated on top of the artwork locations for whicoh they are related to. That being every dot placement is situatied to a location on the artwork the infromation relates to.
    The pixellation artwork and the previous png have been kept as serpate pieces of  information to allows the under to observe an undisturbed version of the artwork to quickly scroll and relation the infromation they have just read to the artwork's orginal image. -->
    <!-- Further I have opted for the pixellation liquidation effect to be analogous of the user "rubbing away" at the artwork's surface, to further learn of the deep insights behind its visual form and imagery, but to also learn of its history and context in Christian folk. -->
