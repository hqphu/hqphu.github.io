      "The Last Judgment" is replete with symbolic elements and allegorical
      figures. Angels and demons battle for souls, symbolizing the eternal
      struggle between good and evil. The resurrection of the dead at the bottom
      of the fresco illustrates the Christian belief in bodily resurrection,
      while Charon, the mythological ferryman of the dead from Dante's
      "Inferno," is included to draw a connection between Christian and
      classical themes of the afterlife. Additionally, the fresco reflects
      Michelangelo's deep understanding of human anatomy and emotion, using
      physical form and expression to convey complex theological ideas about
      sin, redemption, and divine justice.
