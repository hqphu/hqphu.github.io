      3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      Sculpting Harmony excites the interaction by providing interactive web 3D
      models for the user to explore the Walt Disney Hall throughout points of
      its development. Architectural models of the musical hall allow to user to
      pan and observe the geometries of the building. This directly activates
      the user’s physical engagement by manipulating the viewpoint of these
      models and allows further immersion and provides reinforced insight into
      the exhibition’s communication. The Getty’s inclusions of such allow the
      user to observe and play with historical artifacts of the music hall’s
      development in real-time. It conveys a sense of realism and involvement
      with these histories, and empowers the education the art exhibit informs.

      4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      Following the interaction of a scrollytelling webpage, Sculpting Harmony
      depends on this interaction to initiate and progress the webpage
      experience. Display content is asynchronous with Dvorak’s Symphony 7 and
      correspondingly depends on the user’s scroll instead to reveal the
      exhibit’s elements. It provides a more immersive visual experience by
      triggering content to the user’s scroll and information is sequenced
      linearly and absorbed for the user’s comprehension of the digital exhibit.
      At various points of the sequence however, particularly at chapter titles,
      Sculpting Harmony adopts more conventional website interactions, allowing
      the user to click to skip and initiate the next section of content.

      5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience? 6) How does the interactive experience communicate this
      primary goal?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      As the journey continues and reveals itself progressively with every
      scroll, it is clear that the user continues the exhibit with this downward
      scroll to its end. Along with following occasional exhibit commands and
      annotations to assist with navigation, downward scrolls become the
      foundational action to and the main path “forward”. Sculpting Harmony
      guides this experience through revealing new content with this single
      gesture. In sections and scene of stagnation, the webpage will provide
      text to determine the next intended action from the user to help progress
      the exhibit onward.

      7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time? (For how long and how many different times) 8) How does the
      interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over
      time?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      The webpage menu provides 5 different major sections and chapters to the
      web experience however, the length of each remains ambiguous to the user.
      There is no indication besides the side scroll bar to suggest the length.
      With each introduction of different interactive web sections, the changing
      video lengths disorient indications of the user’s progression. In way’s,
      the user is forced to remain in anticipation of the exhibit’s next
      presentation. Sculpting Harmony does allow the user to jump content
      offerings however, the original single scroll layout is preserved as the
      main path of the webpage/exhibitions navigation. By entering and exiting
      through exhibit content, users are eventually returned to this path as
      they absorb the website’s content as they switch between passive and
      active interaction with the website’s media.

      9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference? 10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
      should act when engaging with your research experience? 11) What does this
      reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging
      with your research experience?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      As the user sequences through the story of Sculpting Harmony, the website
      transitions between written text, documentaries of interviews with Frank
      Gehry and 3D model of the Walt Disney Music Hall during its architectural
      development. The structuring of this digital content is still systemic
      however, it generally follows TEXT -> Video Documentary -> 3D Interactive
      Artifact. This formula structures the scrollytelling format for the
      digital art exhibit and its relative chapters. With some chapters
      exclusively exhibiting video media, user expectations are unintuitive,
      although this sensibility effectively makes users submit to the exhibit’s
      narrative and forthcoming story. It is evident that with the webpage’s
      experience, users are to simply absorb the exhibit and its presentations,
      opposed to a complete self-autonomy in its information. In this sense, the
      website becomes a strategic narrative experience, one to educate and
      insight readers of the Walt Disney Music Halls conception.

      12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part frustrating?
    </h1>
    <p class="libre-caslon">
      Although transitions assist continuity and seamlessness between the
      exhibit scenes, transitions and animations can become hindrances in user’s
      mobility up and down the webpage. While these are intended to immerse
      information between content and chapters, this affords the user time to
      process or complete these visual effects before they are able to return to
      previously viewed scenes or jump sections. While the website addresses
      this through a menu bar accessible in the top right, the menu in itself
      contains transitions for bold display fonts and transitions to transport
      the user back to specific sections of the exhibit.

      13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
      makes that part satisfying?

    <p class="libre-caslon">
      Despite this, Sculpting Harmony by the Getty, and its website transport’s
      its audience into a deeply immersive web experience, translating its
      platform into a multisensory digital exhibit. The website’s scrollytelling
      content invites users to unwind, and allows it to display and sequence the
      experience for the user. With the simple gesture of a scroll, new content
      reveals itself with multimedia displays delivering the history of The Walt
      Disney Concert Hall’s conception. Homaging architectural and engineering
      pioneering, and cultural and community shifts, this experience preserves
      the site’s heritage by engaging and implementing text, image, video, and
      3D computer graphic media, into a captivating digital account.
