      Oh, and another scroll! The Sculpting Harmony follows a scrollytelling web
      format and relies on the user scroll progression to initiate the
      storytelling experience. The website introduces various interactive
      multimedia elements from images, videos, diagrams and even interactive 3D
      models of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It is through Sculpting Harmony,
      the Getty presents how the Walt Disney Concert Hall established in Los
      Angeles came to be. Spamming scrolls and clicks are able to skip parts of
      the website scroll. But during key sections of the webpage, media begins
      to spread the entire viewport to visually indicate a point of user
      immersion to consume exhibition content. Point bars are provided to pause,
      play and skip parts of these video sequences and assist navigation. To
      engage audiences with the web-exhibit, the Getty displays and uses a
      variety of media forms such as interactive 3D models to explore the
      building structure, documentaries delivered from Frank Gehry himself, and
      changing music compositions featured in the Walt Disney Music Hall.
